# MPNST Surfaceome
This repository contains the master scripts and data to reproduce analyses in Largaespada lab manuscript detailing the MPNST cell surfaceome.

Included is a master script which runs through all data and analyzes accordingly, alongsize a function script that is sourced in the master.
The function script is primarily for a [ProteomicsDB](https://www.proteomicsdb.org) web scraper that can get proteomics data for individual protein lists and create a matrix for all protein x tissue values.
